<h1>About this Application</h1>

<p><em>Proman<sup>&beta;</sup></em> is an application that helps manage undergraduate final year projects. It provides the following benefits:
	<ul>
		<li><em>For supervisors</em>: it provides a convenient on-line method for setting your projects and specifying which disciplines they are suitable for. After allocation, it will provide a convenient link to your students.</li>
		<li><em>For students</em>: it handles the project selection and allocation process. It allows you to browse the projects by discipline, supervisor and research centre; to make a shortlist of the projects that interest you, and to rank these in order of preference. Once your project has been allocated, it <em>Proman<sup>&beta;</sup></em> will provide you with a link to your supervisor, his/her research group and your project coordinator.</li>
		<li><em>For coordinators</em> <em>Proman<sup>&beta;</sup></em> provides a convenient dash board for accessing information on the projects, supervisors and their students.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This project is a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application. It was developed by ICCT student Nicolay Parashkenov during the academic year 2009-2009. Nicolay was supervised and this software is now maintained by Dr Chris P. Jobling, who is the Research Project (EG-353) Coordinator for the School of Engineering, Swansea University.

<p>This is beta-quality software, and as is the tradition in Web2.0, is likely to remain so!
